# CreaweS3D
> Creawesome profiles that are S3D-compatible

The goal of this project is to create Simplify3D-compatible "Factory Files" (.fff) that include the settings from the popular "Creawsome mod" for Cura 4.0+ (https://github.com/trouch/CreawsomeMod)

## Installation

In the Simplify3D main window, select from the menu bar File > Import Factory Profile... and open the .fff file that corresponds to your printer.

To add the virtual printer model to your viewport, select from the menu bar Tools > Options, select the Machine tab, and add the desired STL to the Printer Models list at bottom of the dialogue.

## Release History

* 0.0.1
    * Initial commit. All FFF files have "material"-specific autoconfigurations included. "Quality"-specific autoconfig is not included.
